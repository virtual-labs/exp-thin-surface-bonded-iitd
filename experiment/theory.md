### OVERVIEW

This simulation experiment is based on the basic analytical model and experimental study involving surface
bonded PZT patches operating in the d<sub>31</sub>-mode for energy harvesting covered in the doctoral thesis of Dr.
Naveet Kaur. (<a href="images/naveet.pdf">naveet.pdf</a>) The d<sub>31</sub>-mode is explored for the possibility of energy harvesting from the PZT patch owing to its well established suitability for SHM, by
means of either the global vibration or the local EMI technique. The principle of integrated SHM and
energy harvesting is illustrated below.<br><br>
The structure is assumed to be operating in two states, idle state and SHM state. During the idle state (when
SHM is not being performed), the PZT patches will harvest the energy and store it in an appropriate storage
device, such as a battery or a capacitor. In the SHM state, the same stored energy will be utilized for the
SHM of the host structure by the same PZT patch, either in the global mode (standard vibration techniques)
or the local mode (EMI technique) or both. It is assumed that the total duration of the SHM state will be
very small as compared to the idle state. In this experiment, the voltage and the power generated by a PZT
patch surface bonded in the d<sub>31</sub>-mode on a bridge beam are measured experimentally.<br><br>
