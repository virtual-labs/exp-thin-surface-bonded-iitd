**Procedure**

This simulation experiment covers three setups: Class A train of vehicles, Class B train of vehicles and Class AA (tracked and wheeled) train of vehicles (Class 70 R). A bridge is considered on which 4 sets of PZT patches are banded. Each set contains 12 PZT patches. So overall, the bridge contains 48 sensors. The bridge has four spans. Initially in energy harvesting stage/idle state, each set of sensors are connected to the battery through wires. The user can change choose the vehicle class (A or B or AA) to pass over the bridge. As the vehicle moves, the mechanical vibrations in the bridge result in generation of voltage across PZT patch generating electrical power. The generated energy is stored inside a battery. In SHM state, SHM device (AD5933) is attached to the damaged span and the fully charged battery. The energy stored inside the battery is used for evalution of each damaged span.

By clicking the appropriate links, the user can download the signatures corresponding to the baseline
(undamaged) and damaged states. To statistically quantify damage, compute root mean square deviation
(RMSD) in conductance by following equation directly in MS excel:

<br><br>
Where<br><br>
 G<sub>i</sub><sup>0</sup> = Baseline conductance value at <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> frequency.<br>
 G<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup> = Conductance value after damage at <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> frequency.<br>
<i>n</i> = No. of frequency data points

As an exercise, plot a histogram of RMSD for the various damaged states. Note your observations and draw conclusions.

<!-- **POST EXPERIMENT TASK**

1) Plot the comparison conductance signatures for undamaged and
damaged spans.<br>
2) Calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for all the
spans by comparing damaged and undamaged signatures?<br>
3) Plot the histogram of RMSD for damage condition along the length
(different spans) of bridge.<br>
4) What is the range of sweep signal?<br>
5) How much is the energy harvested from vibrations in ÂµW, when the
bridge vibrates for 1 minute. Assume the bridge to be three span
